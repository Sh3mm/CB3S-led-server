# Local Wifi Led strip

Project made to adapt a Genni "Smart" led strip that required an app and a cloud connection into a local only Wifi led strip that communicates through an HTTP server hosted on the chip.

The chip is a [CB3S from tuya](https://docs.libretiny.eu/boards/cb3s/). 

The code depends on [libretiny](https://docs.libretiny.eu/).
